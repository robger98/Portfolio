# Portfolio
This is a collection of a few projects I have worked on, mostly for classes I have taken throughout my undergraduate and master studies. The goal of this portfolio is to display a core understanding of the theory behind several machine learning techniques. This conceptual understanding is shown through the from-scratch implementations in python showcased below. I believe my greatest strength in machine learning and data science is my ability to quickly grasp the underlying concepts of different ML techniques and to leverage that understanding for extensions on existing methods. Thank you for reviewing my portfolio!

## Bayesian Inference
This project focused on performing different methods of bayesian inference, namely exact inference (enumeration ask), likelihood weighting, and Gibbs sampling. 

## CNN Project
This is a simple project I made as a TA for an Advanced AI course. It explores using CNNs for image classification on the fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal was to provide a gentle introduction into both CNNs and `Tensorflow`.

## Constraint Satisfaction
This project is an implementation of the a CSP solver algorithm, with various extensions, including AC-3 and 3 variable ordering methods. It is set to run on sudoku and synthetically generated constraint problems.

## Decision Tree
This is an implementation of the decision tree learner algorithm. It can also output the final decision tree graph using the `networkx` package.

## Transformer from Scratch (WIP)
I am currently working on this project, with the intention of setting up a project for future students to familiarize themselves with the transformer architecture. It is set to be used on next-word prediction tasks using a decoder-only architecture implemented in `Tensorflow`. Currently, the model suffers from overfitting, most likely due to a subpar training regime and hyperparameter selection. I am working on improving these issues.

## Simple NN from Scratch
In this project I created a class to build fully connected feed forward neural networks from scratch, using only `numpy`. Per the project requirements, the network hyperparameters and data are passed through a configuration file, the format of which is described in the comments. Included are some example config/data files, as well as a script to generate simple data. It is only capable of runnning on the CPU, so it is limited in functionality, but it was a great learning experience.
