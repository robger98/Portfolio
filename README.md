# Portfolio

This is a collection of a few project I have worked on, mostly for classes I have taken throughout my undergraduate and master studies.

## CNN Project
This is a simple project I made as a TA for Advanced AI. It explores using CNNs for image classifcation on the fashion-MNIST dataset. This makes use of tensorflow.

## Simple NN from Scratch
In this project I created a class to build fully connected feed forward neural networks from scratch, using only numpy. Per the project requirements, the network parameters and data are passed through a config file, the format of which is described in the comments. Included are some example config/data files, as well as a script to generate simple data. It is only capable of runnning on the CPU, so it is limited in functionality, but it was a great learning experience.
