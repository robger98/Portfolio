# Portfolio

This is a collection of a few project I have worked on, mostly for classes I have taken throughout my undergraduate and master studies.

## Bayesian Inference
This project focused on performing different methods of bayesian inference, namely exact inference (enumeration ask), likelihood weighting, and Gibbs sampling. 

## CNN Project
This is a simple project I made as a TA for Advanced AI. It explores using CNNs for image classifcation on the fashion-MNIST dataset. This makes use of tensorflow.

## Constraint Satisfaction
This project is an implementation of the a CSP solver algorithm, with various extensions, including AC-3 and 3 variable ordering methods. It is set to run on sudoku and synthetically generated constraint problems.

## Decision Tree
This is an implementation of the decision tree learner algorithm. It can also output the final decision tree graph using the networkx package.

## Transformer from Scratch (WIP)
I am currently working on this project, with the intention of setting up a project for future students to familiarize themselves with the transformer architecture. It is set to be used on next-word prediction tasks using a decoder-only architecture implemented in Tensorflow. Currently, the model suffers from overfitting, most likely due to a subpar training data and hyperparameter selection. I am working on improving these issues.

## Simple NN from Scratch
In this project I created a class to build fully connected feed forward neural networks from scratch, using only numpy. Per the project requirements, the network parameters and data are passed through a config file, the format of which is described in the comments. Included are some example config/data files, as well as a script to generate simple data. It is only capable of runnning on the CPU, so it is limited in functionality, but it was a great learning experience.
